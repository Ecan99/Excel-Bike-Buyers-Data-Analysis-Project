# Excel-Bike-Buyers-Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes a dataset of bike buyers, focusing on demographics, income, commute distance, and purchasing behavior. The goal was to clean the raw data, prepare it for analysis, and build interactive dashboards to uncover insights.

🛠 Steps Taken
1. Data Preparation

 - Removed duplicate records.
 - Standardized formats and ensured consistency across columns.

2. Feature Engineering
 - Added an Age Rank column to group customers into categories:
 - Young Professionals (≤35)
 - Mid Career (36–49)
 - Seniors (≥50)

3. Analysis
 - Built Pivot Tables to summarize:
 - Average Income vs Bike Purchase (by Gender)
 - Bike Purchases by Age Rank
 - Bike Purchases by Commute Distance

4. Dashboard
 - Combined pivot charts into a single Bike Sales Dashboard.
 - Added slicers for filtering by Marital Status, Region, and Education.
 - Customized layout for clarity and professional presentation.
